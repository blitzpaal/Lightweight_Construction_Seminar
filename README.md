# UniversityProjects

In this repository I will work on code that will be needed for some upcoming assignments for my semester. Im not sure if I will make issues, but if I do, feel free to contribute.

The first (and maybe only) project in this rep will be a code/script for making "Classical Laminate Theory" calculations with Python for a lightweight-construction seminar.
